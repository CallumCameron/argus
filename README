argus

1. "argus.py" is an utility for switching easily the resolution,
position and ratation for all the screens connected to the computer.

2. "monitor_switch.sh" is an utility to move the active window between
daul head monitors. It can be invoked with a keyboard shortcut after
binding the shell script file to it.

The introduction of argus.py is as the follows.


We carry our laptop computer to different places, such as workshop,

office, home, etc., where we connect it with different monitors. We

click the mouse to setup the resolution, position, ratation for every

monitor repeatly.



With Arugus, the untility for saving your current setting of

display/monitor, you can collect automaticlly for all the

display/monitor connected to your computer into a shell code, which

later you can run to restore the setting.



What you need is just remember the name of the shell code, which

brings you all the information of your favorate working environment as

soon as you run it.



An simple example is as the follow.



I have a Dell display in 23 inch, which can rotate vertically for

programmer easilly browsing a large scale of code with out pagedown

or pageup, as well as rotate horizantally for watching movie without

black edge.



I turn the monitor left, before setting up the layout (position and

mode and rotation) for it with System->Monitors in Ubuntu. Then, I run



: ~ $ arugus.py -s programming.sh



to cteate a file named programming.sh excutable.



: ~ $ cat programming.sh

: #!/bin/bash

: xrandr --output VGA1 --pos 0x0 --mode 1920x1080 --rotate left

: xrandr --output LVDS1 --pos 0x1920 --mode 1280x800 --rotate normal



I turn the monitor horizatally, then also set up the current layout

manually with GUI System->Monitors. I save the current setting as movie.sh.





: ~ $ arugus.py -s movie.sh

: ~ $ cat movie.sh

: #!/bin/bash

: xrandr --output VGA1 --pos 0x0 --mode 1920x1080 --rotate normal

: xrandr --output LVDS1 --pos 248x1080 --mode 1280x800 --rotate normal



Once completed the steps above, we can switch the working condition

with running the corresponding shell code. 



When I watch movie,



: ~$ ./movie.sh



when I input code,



: ~$ ./programming.sh



In my office, in my classroom with projector, or in my workshop, I can

switch my laptop to the suitable state.



We can return whatever we have been, if only we remember. Yesterday

oncemore.



Dependency:



xrandr, you usually have.



python, you usually have.



bash, you usually have.
